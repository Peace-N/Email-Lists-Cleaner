/*============================== Separate Semi-Colon Delimited Emails into arrays or Individual Pieces =====================
This Programme was Written by Peace Ngara after a Web Project that had email lists separated by a semicolon ;
e.g peacengara@aol.com ; peacengara@yahoo.com ;
The email lists were more than 5000 making it impossible to copy and paste in an Email Sending Programme.

/* ============================== The Challenge =================================== 

Export to Excel or Comma Delimited Listst */
